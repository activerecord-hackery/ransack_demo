# Ransack Demo Application

This is a quick demonstration of how you might use
[Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack) in a Rails 5
application to create an "advanced" search form, with nesting, etc.

The main things you'll want to note are:

* app/models/user.rb - Demonstration of:
  - using a "ransacker" (a virtual, searchable "column") to allow searching on
    full names from concatenated first and last names.
  - whitelisting attributes allowed for searching using `ransackable_attributes`.
  - whitelisting attributes allowed for sorting using `ransortable_attributes`.
* app/views/users/ - Search form and various partials used in dynamic form.
* app/helpers/application_helper.rb - `setup_search_form`, which creates a
  Javascript search object with a grouping template, since we can't dynamically
  create grouping templates in Ruby (groupings can contain other groupings,
  would end up in infinite recursion). The rest of the methods in here are
  pretty much the same as the nested field helpers in Ryan Bates'
  [Railscast #197](http://railscasts.com/episodes/197-nested-model-form-part-2).
* app/assets/javascripts/search.js - JS to handle addition/removal of fields, as
  well as nesting fields (adding a grouping from the previously mentioned
  grouping template)

Let us know if you have any questions, and happy ransacking!
